## Live Demo

You can view the live application here: [Dork Application](https://dork-application.vercel.app/)

## Contributing

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pasamyagnesh/dorkcode.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd dorkcode`
3. Run the server: `node server.js`

The application will run on port 3000. To access it locally on your network, find your IP address using the `ipconfig` command and visit `http://<YOUR_IP>:3000/` in your browser.

## Notes

- Ensure all devices on the same network are connected and use the IP address format `000.00.00.000:3000` to access the app.
